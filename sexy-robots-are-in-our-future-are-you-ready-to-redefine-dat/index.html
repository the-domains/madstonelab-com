<p>Humans have never been satisfied with the natural world we've been born into. We have been hacking it from day one. But in our pursuit to gain advantage over our circumstances, will we eliminate the need for the one thing that distinguishes us from all other species- the need for each other? Is this Brave New World the beginning of the end, or a footnote in the evolution of human sexuality? Are we wading into dangerous waters where powerful technology will own, access, and exploit everything that makes us human? Are we ready for a future where companies monitor, mine and manipulate our emotional and sexual metadata and replace our human mates with AI controlled robots?  </p><p>The dystopian novel Brave New World by Aldous Huxley warned us of the siren call of technology. Brave New World poses the question: at what cost does this happiness come? What gets lost when every one of an individual's desires is immediately met? The novel's answer is that the satisfaction of every desire develops a superficial and infantile happiness that creates stability by eliminating deep thought, new ideas, and strong passions. Without ideas or passions, mankind loses the possibility of more significant fulfillments provided by the pursuit of truth in art and science, or the pursuit of love and understanding with another person. Brave New World argues that happiness and stability are fool's gold, making adults into infants who do not care about truth or progress.</p><p>Sex as we know it may prevail, or technology may disrupt the way we get off, and give our real life sex partners a run for their money. As we move forward into this brave new world, the laws of attraction will be challenged by virtual temptations. Will this world lead us to a new unrealized freedom and ecstasy, or are we forging the the future technological chains that will enslave us in our own desires?</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-vibrant colors-global " data-reactid="14"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="15"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="16"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="17"><span data-reactid="18"><!-- react-empty: 19 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="20"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="21"></a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="24"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
