[Sexy robots are in our future. Are you ready to redefine date night?][0]

Is [Oculus Rift][1] the platform from which a new kind of sexuality will emerge?  Who knew that the new sexual revolution would be ushered in by geeks and engineers? Will this technology displace the need for humans to share sex with each other when all of your desires and fantasies can be satisfied and improved upon with technology? Dating sites and  pick up lines could go the way of rotary phones and eight track players.  Is it possible that the advent of virtual reality technology combined with advancement of artificial intelligence and robotics will offer a superior preferential experience than our own limited biology and social circumstances can offer? 

[DeepMind, Google's taciturn artificial intelligence arm, announced that its program, AlphaGo, defeated Fan Hui][2], the current champion of the game that was developed in China 2,500 years ago.  Go is a game of profound complexity. There are more possible positions in Go than there are atoms in the universe. That makes Go at times far more complex than chess. If technology can advance AI to the point where computers have intuition than its possible that from that intuition the ultimate sex partner can emerge. Human sexuality is hardwired for procreation and mutual satisfaction. An AI sex partner can be decoupled from all these unconscious prerequisites and learn from us what our deepest desires and evolve into the ultimate selfless sex partner. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ecedd16a-6b2c-4029-8f46-6f2d64237367.jpg)

Humans have never been satisfied with the natural world we've been born into. We have been hacking it from day one. But in our pursuit to gain advantage over our circumstances, will we eliminate the need for the one thing that distinguishes us from all other species- the need for each other? Is this Brave New World the beginning of the end, or a footnote in the evolution of human sexuality? Are we wading into dangerous waters where powerful technology will own, access, and exploit everything that makes us human? Are we ready for a future where companies monitor, mine and manipulate our emotional and sexual metadata and replace our human mates with AI controlled robots?  

The dystopian novel Brave New World by Aldous Huxley warned us of the siren call of technology. Brave New World poses the question: at what cost does this happiness come? What gets lost when every one of an individual's desires is immediately met? The novel's answer is that the satisfaction of every desire develops a superficial and infantile happiness that creates stability by eliminating deep thought, new ideas, and strong passions. Without ideas or passions, mankind loses the possibility of more significant fulfillments provided by the pursuit of truth in art and science, or the pursuit of love and understanding with another person. Brave New World argues that happiness and stability are fool's gold, making adults into infants who do not care about truth or progress.

Sex as we know it may prevail, or technology may disrupt the way we get off, and give our real life sex partners a run for their money. As we move forward into this brave new world, the laws of attraction will be challenged by virtual temptations. Will this world lead us to a new unrealized freedom and ecstasy, or are we forging the the future technological chains that will enslave us in our own desires?
